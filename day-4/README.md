# Custom Linux Images in Cloud
For example, after setting up (mongo)db once, including enabling it so it runs persistently on startup, a custom image of that instance can be made so that a usable/connectable db instance can be created without even having to SSH into it.

**Image = OS, filesystem, software (installed+configured)**
