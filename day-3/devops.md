# DevOps
All about different teams not being silo'd
- DevOps is like an extension of AGILE, bringing all teams together
    - Dev, UX, Ops, Marketing, Sales
- Often via automation to make cross-team work as smooth as possible

Originally came from the Dev team and Ops team being segregated, not working efficiently together
- Dev - developing the actual code
- Ops - focused on deployment

It's the job of DevOps engineers to efficiently bridge this gap, facilitating their teamwork.
- This has since developed to be broader, across more teams
