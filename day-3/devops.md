# DevOps
All about different teams not being silo'd
- DevOps is like an extension of AGILE, bringing all teams together
    - Dev, UX, Ops, Marketing, Sales
- Often via automation to make cross-team work as smooth as possible

Originally came from the Dev team and Ops team being segregated, not working efficiently together
- Dev - developing the actual code
- Ops - focused on deployment

It's the job of DevOps engineers to efficiently bridge this gap, facilitating their teamwork.
- This has since developed to be broader, across more teams

## Pillars of DevOps (varies)
- **Culture** - fostering a collaborative environment with shared responsibility, communication, blameless mindset
- **Automation** - automating repetitive tasks in the software development lifecycle to increase speed and reduce errors
- **Measurement** - using data and feedback to make informed decisions, measure performance, identify areas for improvement
- **Sharing** - sharing knowledge, tools responsibility across teams to break down silos
- **Learning** - embracing failure as a learning opportunity and continuously seeking to improve processes and outcomes

**Everything revolves around the CI/CD pipeline**
