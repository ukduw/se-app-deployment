# Autoscaling
A cloud computing feature that automatically adjusts a server's capacity up or down to match the current demand

### Web app traffic scenario
Multiple web app instances. Users are directed to them via load balancer. As more or less users try to access web app, more 'out the box' instances can be spun up or terminated as needed.
- Cloud monitoring alarms triggered as demand increases/decreases
- On trigger, increase/decrease resources (number of instances, in this case) in line with demand
